## Meet Riggs

Riggs is a 9-year-old third grader with a big imagination and an even bigger heart. When heâ€™s not at school in Daytona Beach, Florida, you can find him tinkering with cameras, exploring new hobbies, or cheering on his siblings at band performances and football games. Riggs loves sharing his curiosity with the world, which inspired the creation of **RiggsTV**, a fun, safe place for kids and families to discover educational and uplifting content together.
